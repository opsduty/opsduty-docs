# OpsDuty

Welcome to OpsDuty, an incident management system designed to help you create a
process tailored to your needs.

The core purpose of OpsDuty is to track incidents, but it also includes built-in
tools to help detect potential issues and support other aspects of your
stability improvement efforts.

- [Heartbeat Monitoring](concepts/heartbeat-monitoring.md) - Make sure your CRON
  and periodic tasks execute and complete successfully as intended.
- [Live Call Routing](concepts/integrations/incoming-calls.md) - Route incoming
  phone calls to the responsible person for a system, enabling real-time
  support.
