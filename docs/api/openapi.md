# OpenAPI

The OpenAPI Specification is a standardized format for defining RESTful APIs in
a machine-readable way, typically using JSON or YAML. It describes all aspects
of an API, including its endpoints, request and response structures,
authentication methods, and error codes. OpenAPI Specification enables clear
communication between developers and allows tools to generate documentation,
client libraries, and server stubs automatically, streamlining the development
and integration process.

OpsDuty exposes its OpenAPI Specification on
[https://opsduty.io/api/v1/openapi.json](https://opsduty.io/api/v1/openapi.json).
