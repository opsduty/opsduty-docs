The team structure in OpsDuty plays a crucial role in managing access controls
and defining ownership for components requiring an assigned owner.

Users can view and manage teams they belong to, including updating the team name
and managing its members.

Team members are also granted permissions to view and modify team-associated
entities such as schedules, escalation policies, and other related objects.

Organization members with the "owner" role have visibility and access to all
teams and their associated objects across the organization.

Teams can be listed and managed on the [teams](https://opsduty.io/app/teams)
page.

## Labels

Teams can configure a set of labels that belong to the team. These labels can be
used to tag resources, such as incidents, when an incident belongs to the team.
