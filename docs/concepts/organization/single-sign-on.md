## Authentication

OpsDuty currently offers two external authentication methods: Google and SAML
authentication. Google authentication is straightforward to set up but may not
be ideal if you have more complex access requirements.

### Google Authentication

Google authentication allows users from a Google Workspace domain to log in to
OpsDuty. You can choose to either manually create user accounts before they
authenticate or enable OpsDuty to automatically create accounts when a user logs
in for the first time, provided no matching email address is found.

Your users can use the `Login with Google` button on the
[login](https://opsduty.io/auth/login/) page when this is enabled.

#### Configuration

1.  Enable the `Enable Google authentication` checkbox.
2.  Provide your Google Workspace domain.
3.  Enable `Register unknown accounts` if you want OpsDuty to create any missing
    user account on first user login if no account already exists.

    !!! danger

         OpsDuty will create any missing user account on successfull authentication
         attempts when `Register unknown accounts` is enabled. It is advisable to enable this
         only if you have complete trust in all members in your Google organization. If disabled,
         users need an invite before login with Google is available.

4.  Save the form to apply your changes.

### SAML Authentication

SAML authentication allows you to use the Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) standard to authenticate users in OpsDuty. Any SAML-compliant
authentication provider can be integrated with OpsDuty, making it ideal for
platforms like Okta or OneLogin to manage user authentication.

Your users can use the `Login with SAML` button on the
[login](https://opsduty.io/auth/login/) page when this is enabled. Users simply
need to provide their organizationâ€™s domain in OpsDuty, after which OpsDuty will
redirect them to the SAML provider for authentication.

### Configuration

1. Set up an entity in your SAML-compatible authentication provider.
2. Enable the `Enable SAML2 authentication` checkbox.
3. Configure the `Metadata URL`, which can be obtained from your authentication
   provider.
