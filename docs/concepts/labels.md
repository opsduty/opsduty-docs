Labels can be used to categorize resources in OpsDuty, making it easier to
locate similar incidents later and to classify incidents on a more granular
level.

Labels can be configured at two levels: the organization level and the team
level. **Organization labels** are available to all resources within the
organization, while **team labels** are limited to resources belonging to that
specific team.

## Organization Labels

Organization labels can be managed on the
[Organization Settings](https://opsduty.io/app/organization/labels) page.

## Team Labels

Team labels can be configured from the team's page. Navigate to the
[Team Overview](https://opsduty.io/app/teams) page and select a team.

Team labels are managed similarly to organization labels, with the added
functionality that team labels can be converted into organization labels.

## Label Configuration

A label consists of a **name** and a **color**. Additionally, labels can be
grouped into **label groups**.

### Label Groups

Label groups are used to organize labels for easier management. However, label
groups are not directly applied when labeling resources in OpsDuty.

It is not mandatory for labels to belong to a label group.
