## OpsDuty contact in your contact list

OpsDuty can be set up to call you for notifications and live call forwarding.
However, OpsDuty may use a phone number you don’t recognize. Since it’s common
to avoid answering unknown numbers, this could result in missed calls from
OpsDuty.

The OpsDuty app allows you to create a contact on your device containing the
known numbers used by OpsDuty. This ensures that calls from OpsDuty are
recognized as such when the contact is saved.

1. Open the OpsDuty app
2. Click `Profile` in the lower right corner
3. Click the `Settings` button
4. Click `Create OpsDuty contact` to create the contact in your contact list
